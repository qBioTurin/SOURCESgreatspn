 - create a new directory where you want the tool will reside,
   for example  
     /usr/local/GreatSPN/
 - extract the archive into the installation directory
     gunzip greatspn-2.0.2-src.tar.gz 
     cd /usr/local/GreatSPN/
     tar -xvf greatspn-2.0.2-src.tar
 - move to the directory where source code reside
     cd  /usr/local/GreatSPN/SOURCES/

   and the other for Linux platforms; edit the appropriate makefile;
 - only the first lines of the makefile have to be changed,
