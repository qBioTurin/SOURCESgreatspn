Dear Andy,
following our suggestions I have integrated in GreatSPN a new solver (WNRGMDD) based on meddly.
This new tool uses saturation and Jacobi method (based on the MatrixVector operator) to solve SPN model computing
the probability vector  and the transitions'  throughput.
Now I'm finishing to prepare a virtualbox image to test it. 
Concerning this I have the following question: the iteration step seem very slow  due to MatrixVector operator (see the kcachegrind).
Is this a my fault or this slow  is normal?
Soon using  virtualbox image you could test it directly.

Ciao
Marco
