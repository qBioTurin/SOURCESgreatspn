/*
  This is a C version of the LSODA library. I acquired the original
  source code from this web page:

    http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/C/kinetics2/index.shtml

  I merged several C files into one and added a simpler interface. I
  also made the array start from zero in functions called by lsoda(),
  and fixed two minor bugs: a) small memory leak in freevectors(); and
  b) misuse of lsoda() in the example.

  The original source code came with no license or copyright
  information. I now release this file under the MIT/X11 license. All
  authors' notes are kept in this file.

I'm told by Steve Nichols at Georgia Tech that you are interested in
a stiff integrator.  Here's a translation of the fortran code LSODA.

Please note
that there is no comment.  The interface is the same as the FORTRAN
code and I believe the documentation in LSODA will suffice.

c this is the march 30, 1987 version of
c lsoda.. livermore solver for ordinary differential equations, with
c         automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems.
c
c this version is in double precision.
c
c lsoda solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
c systems of first order ode-s,
c     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
c     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(neq)) (i = 1,...,neq).
c
c this a variant version of the lsode package.
c it switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods.
c this means that the user does not have to determine whether the
c problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the
c appropriate method.  it always starts with the nonstiff method.

c summary of usage.
c
c communication between the user and the lsoda package, for normal
c situations, is summarized here.  this summary describes only a subset
c of the full set of options available.  see the full description for
c details, including alternative treatment of the jacobian matrix,
c optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and
c instructions for special situations.  see also the example
c problem (with program and output) following this summary.
c
c a. first provide a subroutine of the form..
c               subroutine f (neq, t, y, ydot)
c               dimension y(neq), ydot(neq)
c which supplies the vector function f by loading ydot(i) with f(i).
c
c b. write a main program which calls subroutine lsoda once for
c each point at which answers are desired.  this should also provide
c for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
c by lsoda.  on the first call to lsoda, supply arguments as follows..
c f      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
c          this name must be declared external in calling program.
c neq    = number of first order ode-s.
c y      = array of initial values, of length neq.
c t      = the initial value of the independent variable.
c tout   = first point where output is desired (.ne. t).
c itol   = 1 or 2 according as atol (below) is a scalar or array.
c rtol   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
c atol   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
c          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
c          to be less than
c             ewt(i) = rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol     if itol = 1, or
c             ewt(i) = rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)  if itol = 2.
c          thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
c          either the absolute error is less than atol (or atol(i)),
c          or the relative error is less than rtol.
c          use rtol = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
c          use atol = 0.0 (or atol(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
c          control.  caution.. actual (global) errors may exceed these
c          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
c itask  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = tout.
c istate = integer flag (input and output).  set istate = 1.
c iopt   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
c rwork  = real work array of length at least..
c             22 + neq * max(16, neq + 9).
c          see also paragraph e below.
c lrw    = declared length of rwork (in user-s dimension).
c iwork  = integer work array of length at least  20 + neq.
c liw    = declared length of iwork (in user-s dimension).
c jac    = name of subroutine for jacobian matrix.
c          use a dummy name.  see also paragraph e below.
c jt     = jacobian type indicator.  set jt = 2.
c          see also paragraph e below.
c note that the main program must declare arrays y, rwork, iwork,
c and possibly atol.
c
c c. the output from the first call (or any call) is..
c      y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
c      t = corresponding value of independent variable (normally tout).
c istate = 2  if lsoda was successful, negative otherwise.
c          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong jt).
c          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
c          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
c          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
c          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad jacobian
c             supplied or wrong choice of jt or tolerances).
c          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (solution
c             component i vanished, and atol or atol(i) = 0.)
c          -7 means work space insufficient to finish (see messages).
c
c d. to continue the integration after a successful return, simply
c reset tout and call lsoda again.  no other parameters need be reset.
c
c e. note.. if and when lsoda regards the problem as stiff, and
c switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the neq by neq
c jacobian matrix, j = df/dy.  for the sake of simplicity, the
c inputs to lsoda recommended in paragraph b above cause lsoda to
c treat j as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by
c difference quotients.  alternatively, j can be treated as a band
c matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the rwork
c array).  also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply
c j in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the jac
c argument.  these alternatives are described in the paragraphs on
c rwork, jac, and jt in the full description of the call sequence below.

   We are current using an Adams method.  Consider switching to bdf.

   If the Lipschitz constant and error estimate are not polluted
   by roundoff, perform the usual test.
   Otherwise, switch to the bdf methods if the last step was
   restricted to insure stability ( irflag = 1 ), and stay with Adams
   method if not.  When switching to bdf with polluted error estimates,
   in the absence of other information, double the step size.

   When the estimates are ok, we make the usual test by computing
   the step size we could have (ideally) used on this step,
   with the current (Adams) method, and also that for the bdf.
   If nq > mxords, we consider changing to order mxords on switching.
   Compare the two step sizes to decide whether to switch.
   The step size advantage must be at least ratio = 5 to switch.
